# Houdini Sandbox
Here's a humble collection of Houdini setups, Python scripts, and VEX code, etc ...

It's here for reference and posterity, shared with the Houdini community. Feel free to explore, adapt, and experiment.

This repository is intentionally undocumented, but I'm eager to collaborate and learn together with fellow Houdini enthusiasts. Let's explore the endless possibilities of Houdini.
Eventualy some of thoses hda/tools/scripts could mature into their own repos.
Happy tinkering!
